## Hey ✋

💰 I’m currently working on a PC game as my main side project (more info soon) 
<br>🧬 I am also still making updates to the [genetic algorithm solver](https://github.com/ezrahuffman/GeneticAlgo) site that I made a while ago. This sight uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the Traveling Sales Person problem and visualizes the process. (Python, TypeScript, ThreeJS, FastAPI, NumPy)

<br><br> 🔭 I am currently looking for web development roles (prefferably Full-Stack), simulation work, or any other field that might deal with interesting technical problems that my skillset could be applied to.

## Background
📖Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Python, C#, Go, HTML/CSS (if you consider them languages)
<br> 🖼️Frameworks/Libraries: React/React Native, FastAPI, .Net (in the context of Unity), ThreeJS
<br> 🛠️Tools/Env: AWS, CI/CD, Databases (SQL and NoSQL), Linux, Git, Docker, Windows
<br> 🎮Game Engines: Unreal (4 & 5), Unity
